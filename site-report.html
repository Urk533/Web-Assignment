	  	<h2 class="moex-hd">My Module Experience</h2>
	  	<p class="moex-par">The module name is Web Development and the module code is CSY1018. Our module leader is Ankit Thapa. Our first class of module stared from mid of april 2021. The module used to be of 1 hour lecture and 2 hour tutorial per day. The module was different for me at the beginning because I have never been through computer related subject after class 10. And it was a bit difficult for me at starting phase. At first the module was very hard because I was not being able to understand the basic learnings that our module leader was teaching us. Our module leader started the module from the concepts of using github and I was really very confused because it was very new for me. After practicing some days I was able to use git hub comfortably. After then our module leader started teaching the basics of HTML and CSS. It was also new for me and became hard at the beginning. Then he goes through the module step by step and completed the module in 2 months from starting. We were given many exercises per topic and we have to complete it in given time. We used to practice the coding in tutorial class with module leader. I read the given notes of module and implemented it practically and after some period my web page became very nice and my coding also improved. So this was my module experience till first term.</p>

	  	<p class="mysde-par">We used to do coding of some portions of the web page related to the topic we are learning but we never did coding to make full web page. The first time we got chance to make a full web page is when the assignment was given to us by the university. In the assignment we were given to make a portfolio site which was divided into five parts as below:</p>
	  	<ul class="mysde-uli">
	  		<li>Home Page</li>
	  		<li>Portfolio Page</li>
	  		<li>Contact Page</li>
	  		<li>CV Page</li>
	  		<li>Site-report Page</li>
