			<p class="d-pro">Programming wasn't my very good skill till I was 19. At age 19 I joined a programming class in  Kathmandu when I got free time and I learned there some basic about computer programming languages. At first I was very uncomfortable learning the codes but after some time I enjoyed coding. This was the reason why I joined computing course in NAMI College. And after I studied computing my programming has been very good and I believe that my skill will improve more in future.</p>

		<div class="despeak">
			<p class="d-speak">I was not very good at public speaking since my child-hood. I used to be a very introvert person and used to feel very shy in front of mass. And when I was at age 15 after completing my SLC I went to learn public speaking skills from toastmaster. It took me four months to acquire those skills. I also think that this is the very important skill that everyone have to learn because this skill is require in every steps of our life.</p>
