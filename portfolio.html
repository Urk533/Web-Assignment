I used to play football since I was 11 years old. I also love watching and also playing football games. I play in winger position while playing football. I love scoring goals.

		<div class="despeak">
			<p class="d-speak">I was not very good at public speaking since my child-hood. I used to be a very introvert person and used to feel very shy in front of mass. And when I was at age 15 after completing my SLC I went to learn public speaking skills from toastmaster. It took me four months to acquire that skills. I also think that this is the very important skill that every one have to learn because this skill is require in every steps of our life.</p>
